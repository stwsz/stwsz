# Hello, I'm Igor Araújo 👋🏼

![Cover software engineer Igor Araújo](/cover.jpg)

I have always been passionate about technology, which led me to dive headfirst into the world of software development. I have a special fondness for front-end development, where I use **Svelte** and **React.js** to create dynamic and engaging experiences. Although my focus is primarily on the front-end, I am starting to explore the world of back-end development, learning and challenging myself at every step. I am always in search of new knowledge, believing that curiosity is the fuel that drives us forward.
